# Elytra Bot Addon

Add an Elytra Bot to Meteor, which will show up in the movement category.
This was literally copied straight from Ion, if you ask me to fix bugs I will laugh at you and then close the issue

# This is remains of a fork from RickyTheRacc

At some point he deleted his repository and this fork became a standalone one.
I have no plans on maintaining/improving/updating it. (Even though it kinda works it is still a huge mess)
